## 🤖 Headless Mode & Authentication

When running in **Headless Mode** for the first time:
1. The tool will attempt to log in.
2. If not authenticated, it will save a screenshot of the QR code to `qrcode.png`.
3. Open `qrcode.png` and scan it with your phone's WhatsApp.
4. The tool will detect the login and proceed.

*Note: It is easier to run once in non-headless mode to authenticate, as the session is saved in `data/chrome_profile`.*
